# Anki Cozmo Kidnapping using Monte Carlo Localization

Members: Nick, Quan, Doug, and Brayton

Goal:
* Implement MCL with Anki Cozmo
* Create Panorama of collected images from which the Cozmo bot can use to find its position and relocate itself.

[Cozmo API](https://data.bit-bots.de/cozmo_sdk_doc/cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/api.html)

Helpful [link](https://github.com/nheidloff/visual-recognition-for-cozmo-with-tensorflow/blob/master/1-take-pictures/take-pictures.py) for taking pictures with cozmo and saving them.

## Setup
### Computer Setup:
1.	Install Anki Cozmo SDK
1.	Enable/install Android Debug Bridge on Android device
1.	Setup environment (recommend using Anaconda): Python 3.8 + required packages in requirements.txt:
   * Create environment:
      ```bash
      conda create -n envname python=3.8
      ```
   * Activate environment:
      ```bash
      conda activate envname
      ```
   * Install all required packages:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

### Mobile Phone (Android) Setup:
1.	Enable USB debugging on Android device
1.	Install Official Cozmo app on phone
1.	Run USB cable from phone to computer
1. Run `adb devices` on CommandPrompt on computer to check and authorize your phone
1.	Open Cozmo app and turn Cozmo bot on 
1.	Connect to Cozmo botâ€™s wifi network.
1.	Enable SDK on Cozmo app

## Tasks
* [ ] Fix MCL code for images (check [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhkxtSn9eo8) and github) (file `my-MCL.py`)
* [ ] Create a panorama (optional)
   * Check openCV Stitching (e.g from prev group: [L.Attai,R.Fuller,C.Rhodes](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/archive/cs371/cozmo/22sp/fuller/Stitching.py))
* [ ] Future:
   * How to improve accuracy
   * How to make it works in dark environment (may use edge detection??)
   * How to localize with just 4 images (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) (divide imgs into $n$ cols then compare w/ $n$ cols of each img for all $m$ ims?)
* [X] How to rotate robot
* [X] How to get image from cozmoâ€™s camera (file `picture-collection.py`)
