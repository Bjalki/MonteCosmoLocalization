Goal:
* Implement MCL with Anki Cozmo
* Create Panorama of collected images from which the Cozmo bot can use to find its position and relocate itself.

Environment: Python 3.8 + required packages in requirements.txt

[Cozmo API](https://data.bit-bots.de/cozmo_sdk_doc/cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/api.html)

Helpful [link](https://github.com/nheidloff/visual-recognition-for-cozmo-with-tensorflow/blob/master/1-take-pictures/take-pictures.py) for taking pictures with cozmo and saving them.

Computer Setup:
1.	Install latest version of Python (python = 3.8)
    * Recommend using Anaconda so that you can use multiple versions of Python at the same time, no need to install/reinstall
1.	Install Anki Cozmo SDK
1.	Enable/install Android Debug Bridge on Android device

Mobile Phone (Android) Setup:
1.	Enable USB debugging on Android device
1.	Install Official Cozmo app on phone
1.	Run USB cable from phone to computer
1.	Open Cozmo app and turn Cozmo bot on 
1.	Connect to Cozmo bot’s wifi network.
1.	Enable SDK on Cozmo app

Tasks:
1.	Write MCL code (check [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhkxtSn9eo8) and github)
1.	How to get image from cozmo’s camera
1.	How to rotate robot
1.	Create a panorama (how many images should we capture?)
1.	Future: 
    * How to improve accuracy
